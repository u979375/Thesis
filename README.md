There are five models to see the influence of the dataset size on the modelâ€™s performance. Each model predicts the race category of the person in the picture where each model uses a specified percentage (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%) of the dataset.

## Data collection

The data is collected from https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/. Under the Datasets header are three files for downloading. The Aligned\&Cropped Faces zip file of 107MB redirects to a Google Drive page where there are two tar.gz files. After downloading and extracting the UTKFace.tar.gz file, you obtain the UTKFace folder. 

## Requisites
* Python 3.7.7.
* Tensorflow-gpu 2.0.0  
* Numpy 1.18.1 
* Scikit-learn 0.22.2post1  
* Matplotlib 3.2.1 


## Running notebooks
Create a folder with Splitting_races_into_folders.ipynb, model20.ipynb, model40.ipynb, model60.ipynb, model80.ipynb and model100.ipynb and the UTKFace folder. After running Splitting_races_into_folders.ipynb five race folders are added to this folder. First obtain these five race folders before running model20.ipynb, model40.ipynb, model60.ipynb, model80.ipynb or model100.ipynb.
